# Deep Neural Networks for Inference of FRAP parameters

## To do
- [x] A few basic architectures; fully-connected, LSTM
- [x] Create project file structure
- [x] Visualize the data in Tensorboard
- [ ] Rudimentary hyperparameter search
- [ ] Create architectures for perfect simulated image data
- [ ] Consider local phase with STFT
- [ ] Create architectures for noisy simulated image data
